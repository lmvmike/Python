A final project for my SFWE 101 (Introduction to Software Engineering), I created a classic arcade-style Space Invaders game using Python, employing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game was structured into several classes, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game's functionality.

Settings Class: This class managed the game's settings, including screen dimensions, background colors, and other configurable parameters.

Ship Class: Responsible for defining the player's spaceship, including its movement, shooting capabilities, and collision detection.

TestAlien (Main) Class: Served as the main driver for the game, initializing the game, managing user input, and coordinating interactions between different game components.

Game_Stats Class: Managed game statistics such as player score, level, and lives remaining, providing a way to track the player's progress.

Button Class: Implemented buttons for user interface elements such as starting the game, pausing, or quitting.

Bullet Class: Defined the behavior of bullets fired by the player's ship, including movement, collision detection with aliens, and handling of bullet limits.

Scoreboard Class: Displayed the player's score and other relevant game information on the screen.

By employing OOP principles, each class encapsulated specific functionality, promoting code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance. Additionally, the project provided hands-on experience in software engineering concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Overall, developing the Space Invaders game was an enriching experience that not only reinforced fundamental programming skills but also introduced essential software engineering practices in a practical and engaging manner.
